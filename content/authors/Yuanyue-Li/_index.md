I am Yuanyue Li, a bioinformatics scientist with a passion for understanding the molecular mechanisms of life by combining experimental and computational methods. I grew up and earned my doctoral degree in China, and then spent several enriching years working in Germany and the United States. Currently, I am leading a research group at Zhejiang University in China. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring the world with my wife and our two daughters.

Metabolites are the foundation of biological activity, playing crucial roles in processes such as energy production, signaling, and the regulation of cellular functions. Understanding their composition and dynamics is essential for deciphering the complex biochemical networks that drive cellular behavior. Mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for measuring molecules with high sensitivity and accuracy. Therefore, I use mass spectrometry as a primary tool to analyze metabolites. I have developed several methods to enhance the capabilities of mass spectrometry in life science research. Feel free to visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/YuanyueLi) page to explore the tools I’ve created.

For more information about my research, please visit my lab's website: [https://LiLab.Cool](https://lilab.cool). I am actively seeking talented research assistants, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers to join my team. If you are interested in my work, don’t hesitate to send me an email—I look forward to hearing from you!
