abstract: Author Summary Viruses often can highly efficiently utilize the host system
  to make huge amounts of viral proteins for their replication; however, which host
  factors are needed by the viruses are largely unknown. We analyzed about one hundred
  Drosophila mutants and found that the pelo mutation in Drosophila inhibited Drosophila
  C virus (DCV) replication. We found pelo is specifically required for high efficiency
  synthesis of proteins of a number of viruses, suggesting that inhibition of pelo
  may mediate a general antiviral activity. We proposed that the function of pelo
  in quality control of protein synthesis is required for high efficiency viral protein
  synthesis. Our study presented here identifies a new host factor, pelo, that is
  specifically required for effective viral replication and it may be a new potential
  therapeutic target for broad-spectrum antiviral therapy.
