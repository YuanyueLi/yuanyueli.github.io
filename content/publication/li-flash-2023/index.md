abstract: Public repositories of metabolomics mass spectra encompass more than 1 billion
  entries. With open search, dot product or entropy similarity comparisons of a single
  MS/MS spectrum take more than 8 hours. Flash entropy search speeds up calculations
  more than 10,000 times to query 1 billion spectra in less than 2 seconds, without
  loss in accuracy. It benefits from using multiple threads and GPU calculations.
  This algorithm can fully exploit large spectral libraries with little memory overhead
  for any mass spectrometry laboratory.
