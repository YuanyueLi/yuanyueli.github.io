abstract: Public repositories of metabolomics mass spectra encompass more than 1 billion
  entries. With open search, dot product or entropy similarity, comparisons of a single
  tandem mass spectrometry spectrum take more than 8 h. Flash entropy search speeds
  up calculations more than 10,000 times to query 1 billion spectra in less than 2 s,
  without loss in accuracy. It benefits from using multiple threads and GPU calculations.
  This algorithm can fully exploit large spectral libraries with little memory overhead
  for any mass spectrometry laboratory.
