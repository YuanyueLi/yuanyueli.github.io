abstract: Overlap of TCR repertoires among individuals provides the molecular basis
  for public T cell responses. By deep-sequencing the TCRβ repertoires of CD4+CD8+
  thymocytes from three individual mice, we observed that a substantial degree of
  TCRβ overlap, comprising ∼10–15% of all unique amino acid sequences and ∼5–10% of
  all unique nucleotide sequences across any two individuals, is already present at
  this early stage of T cell development. The majority of TCRβ sharing between individual
  thymocyte repertoires could be attributed to the process of convergent recombination,
  with additional contributions likely arising from recombinatorial biases; the role
  of selection during intrathymic development was negligible. These results indicate
  that the process of TCR gene recombination is the major determinant of clonotype
  sharing between individuals.
