abstract: Abstract The arrangement of proteins into complexes is a key organizational
  principle for many cellular functions. Although the topology of many complexes has
  been systematically analyzed in isolation, their molecular sociology in situ remains
  elusive. Here, we show that crude cellular extracts of a eukaryotic thermophile,
  Chaetomium thermophilum, retain basic principles of cellular organization. Using
  a structural proteomics approach, we simultaneously characterized the abundance,
  interactions, and structure of a third of the C. thermophilum proteome within these
  extracts. We identified 27 distinct protein communities that include 108 interconnected
  complexes, which dynamically associate with each other and functionally benefit
  from being in close proximity in the cell. Furthermore, we investigated the structure
  of fatty acid synthase within these extracts by cryoEM and this revealed multiple,
  flexible states of the enzyme in adaptation to its association with other complexes,
  thus exemplifying the need for in situ studies. As the components of the captured
  protein communities are known?at both the protein and complex levels?this study
  constitutes another step forward toward a molecular understanding of subcellular
  organization.
