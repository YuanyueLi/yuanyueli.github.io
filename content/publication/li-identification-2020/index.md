abstract: "MOTIVATION: Untargeted mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a powerful method for\
  \ detecting metabolites in biological samples. However, fast and accurate identification\
  \ of the metabolites' structures from MS/MS spectra is still a great challenge.\
  \ RESULTS: We present a new analysis method, called SubFragment-Matching (SF-Matching)\
  \ that is based on the hypothesis that molecules with similar structural features\
  \ will exhibit similar fragmentation patterns. We combine information on fragmentation\
  \ patterns of molecules with shared substructures and then use random forest models\
  \ to predict whether a given structure can yield a certain fragmentation pattern.\
  \ These models can then be used to score candidate molecules for a given mass spectrum.\
  \ For rapid identification, we pre-compute such scores for common biological molecular\
  \ structure databases. Using benchmarking datasets, we find that our method has\
  \ similar performance to CSI: FingerID and those very high accuracies can be achieved\
  \ by combining our method with CSI: FingerID. Rarefaction analysis of the training\
  \ dataset shows that the performance of our method will increase as more experimental\
  \ data become available. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SF-Matching is available\
  \ from http://www.bork.embl.de/Docu/sf_matching. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary\
  \ data are available at Bioinformatics online."
