abstract: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induced cell death in murine fibrosarcoma L929
  cells is a model system in studying programed necrosis (also known as necroptosis).
  Receptor interacting protein 3 (RIP3), a serine?threonine kinase, is known to play
  an essential role in TNF-induced necroptosis; however, the phosphorylation events
  initiated by RIP3 activation in necroptotic process is still largely unknown. Here,
  we performed a quantitative MS based analysis to compare TNF-induced changes in
  the global phosphoproteome of wild-type (RIP3+/+) and RIP3-knockdown L929 cells
  at different time points after TNF treatment. A total of 8058 phosphopeptides spanning
  6892 phosphorylation sites in 2762 proteins were identified in the three experiments,
  in which cells were treated with TNF for 0.5, 2, and 4 h. By comparing the phosphorylation
  sites in wild-type and RIP3-knockdown L929 cells, 174, 167, and 177 distinct phosphorylation
  sites were revealed to be dependent on RIP3 at the 0.5, 2, and 4 h time points after
  TNF treatment, respectively. Notably, most of them were not detected in a previous
  phosphoproteomic analysis of RIP3-dependent phosphorylation in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
  peritoneal macrophages and TNF-treated murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), suggesting
  that the data presented in this report are highly relevant to the study of TNF-induced
  necroptosis of L929 cells.
