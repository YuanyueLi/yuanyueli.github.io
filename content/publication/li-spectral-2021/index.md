abstract: Compound identification in small-molecule research, such as untargeted metabolomics
  or exposome research, relies on matching tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra
  against experimental or in silico mass spectral libraries. Most software programs
  use dot product similarity scores. Here we introduce the concept of MS/MS spectral
  entropy to improve scoring results in MS/MS similarity searches via library matching.
  Entropy similarity outperformed 42 alternative similarity algorithms, including
  dot product similarity, when searching 434,287 spectra against the high-quality
  NIST20 library. Entropy similarity scores proved to be highly robust even when we
  added different levels of noise ions. When we applied entropy levels to 37,299 experimental
  spectra of natural products, false discovery rates of less than 10% were observed
  at entropy similarity score 0.75. Experimental human gut metabolome data were used
  to confirm that entropy similarity largely improved the accuracy of MS-based annotations
  in small-molecule research to false discovery rates below 10%, annotated new compounds
  and provided the basis to automatically flag poor-quality, noisy spectra.
