abstract: Autophagy has diverse biological functions and is involved in many biological
  processes. The L929 cell death induced by the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe)-fluoromethyl
  ketone (zVAD) was shown to be an autophagy-mediated death for which RIP1 and RIP3
  were both required. It was also reported that zVAD can induce a small amount of
  TNF production, which was shown to be required for zVAD-induced L929 cell death,
  arguing for the contribution of autophagy in the zVAD-induced L929 cell death. In
  an effort to study RIP3 mediated cell death, we identified regulator of G-protein
  signaling 19 (RGS19) as a RIP3 interacting protein. We showed that RGS19 and its
  partner Gα-inhibiting activity polypeptide 3 (GNAI3) are involved in zVAD-, but
  not TNF-, induced cell death. The role of RGS19 and GNAI3 in zVAD-induced cell death
  is that they are involved in zVAD-induced autophagy. By the use of small hairpin
  RNAs and chemical inhibitors, we further demonstrated that zVAD-induced autophagy
  requires not only RIP1, RIP3, PI3KC3 and Beclin-1, but also RGS19 and GNAI3, and
  this autophagy is required for zVAD-induced TNF production. Collectively, our data
  suggest that zVAD-induced L929 cell death is a synergistic result of autophagy,
  caspase inhibition and autocrine effect of TNF.
